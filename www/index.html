AngularJS uses something called 2 way binding to update the values as they are changed on either end of the binding. If the value of the variable was to change, the text in the dropdown would change. If the text in the dropdown (imagine a textbox if it helps) were to change, the change would immediately be reflected in the variable which is in the controller.-->
